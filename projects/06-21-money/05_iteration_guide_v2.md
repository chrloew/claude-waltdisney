# Iteration Guide (Iteration 2)

## Iteration Overview
**Iteration Number**: 2  
**Triggered By**: Over-complexity and excessive costs making strategy unviable for semi-passive individual investor  
**Focus Areas**: Dramatic simplification, cost reduction, ETF-based implementation, retail investor appropriateness

## Key Issues to Address
- Strategy complexity has exceeded individual investor capability (institutional-level sophistication required)
- €65k costs (6.5% of capital) create mathematical impossibility - need 66-86% gross returns for 60-80% net targets
- Multiple specialist coordination (4 advisors) creates execution complexity unsuitable for semi-passive approach
- Professional technology stack (€500/month) inappropriate for €1M individual portfolio
- Momentum-based rebalancing requires market timing skills beyond stated investor experience
- Individual stock selection with restrictive criteria may force concentration in overvalued securities

## Preserved Elements
- Core 60/40 growth/income allocation structure remains sound for risk-return profile
- Quarterly management cycle is appropriate for semi-passive investor
- Austrian tax optimization focus and European regulatory compliance approach
- Three-phase implementation timeline provides proper structure
- Risk management principles (position limits, stress testing, emergency exits) are valuable
- 60-80% realistic return targets with 100% stretch goal

## Specific Guidance for Next Phase

### If Returning to Realist:
**Preserve**: Three-phase structure, 60/40 allocation concept, Austrian tax focus, quarterly management, realistic return targets  
**Adjust**: Switch to ETF-based implementation, reduce to 2 advisors maximum, retail technology tools, €40-45k total budget  
**Reconsider**: Individual stock selection (use growth ETFs), momentum timing (use simple rebalancing), specialist coordination complexity  
**Strengthen**: Simplicity and executability for semi-passive investor, cost-effectiveness, sustainable management requirements

### Alternative Simplification Approach:
**Core Strategy**: 60% growth ETFs + 40% dividend ETFs with covered call overlay  
**Advisor Structure**: Primary financial advisor + Austrian tax specialist only  
**Technology**: Retail brokerage platform with basic options capability  
**Management**: Quarterly rebalancing based on allocation drift, not market timing  
**Costs**: Target €40k total (4% of capital) for viable net return mathematics

## Success Criteria for This Iteration
- Total implementation costs under €45k (4.5% of capital maximum)
- Strategy executable by semi-passive investor with quarterly 4-6 hour commitment
- Maximum 2 professional advisors required for ongoing management
- ETF-based approach reduces individual security selection complexity
- Retail-appropriate technology stack under €200/month total
- Clear decision rules eliminate market timing requirements
- Maintain 60-80% return targets while achieving cost efficiency

## Lessons Learned
- Initial simplification attempt over-corrected toward institutional complexity
- Cost structure must be mathematically viable - high costs doom return targets
- Semi-passive investor preference must drive all design decisions, not theoretical optimization
- ETF-based implementation may be more appropriate than individual stock selection for this investor profile
- Professional-grade tools and multiple specialists are inappropriate for individual portfolio context
- Simplicity and executability trump theoretical sophistication for long-term success

## Recommended ETF-Based Framework
- **Growth Component (60%)**: 2-3 broad-based growth ETFs (US, Europe, Technology)
- **Income Component (40%)**: 2-3 dividend ETFs suitable for covered call writing
- **Management**: Simple allocation drift rebalancing quarterly
- **Options Strategy**: Covered calls on dividend ETF positions only
- **Advisors**: Financial advisor for strategy oversight + Austrian tax specialist
- **Platform**: Interactive Brokers or similar retail platform with options capability
