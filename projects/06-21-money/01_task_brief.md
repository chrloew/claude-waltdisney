## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope:
- Investment strategy development for 1 million euro capital
- Portfolio allocation recommendations across asset classes

### Out of Scope:

- Cryptocurrency or speculative investments
- Emerging market or frontier market investments
- Real estate direct investments

- **Budget**: 1 million euros available for investment
- **Timeline**: 2-year investment horizon with no interim liquidity needs
- **Resources**: Limited time for active management (passive to semi-active approach preferred)
- **Technical**: Focus on regulated markets in Europe and US
- **Organizational**: Austrian tax residency requirements and regulations

## Success Criteria
- Achieve 80-100% total returns within 2 years (target: 1.8-2.0 million euros final value)

## Stakeholders

- Financial advisors/tax consultants: Ensuring compliance and optimization

### Secondary Stakeholders
- Austrian tax authorities: Compliance with investment income regulations
- Family members: Potentially affected by investment outcomes

### End Users
- Primary investor who will monitor and benefit from the investment strategy

## Context & Background
The investor has 1 million euros available for a 2-year investment with the goal of doubling the money. They have some stock trading experience and maintain a moderately aggressive risk tolerance. This is not critical capital, providing some flexibility for higher-risk strategies. The investor prefers a relatively passive approach and wants to focus on established markets (Europe/US) rather than speculative or emerging market investments.

## Special Considerations
- Austrian tax implications for different investment vehicles and strategies
- Need to balance aggressive return targets with moderate risk tolerance
- Preference for established, regulated markets limits some high-return opportunities
- 2-year timeframe is relatively short for traditional wealth-building strategies
- No previous attempts at similar return targets provides clean slate for strategy development

## Questions & Assumptions
- Assumed current low-interest environment continues during investment period
- Austrian tax treatment of capital gains and dividends will remain stable
- Investor can withstand potential interim volatility for 24-month period
- No major economic disruptions or market crashes during investment timeframe
- Investor comfortable with portfolio rebalancing 2-4 times per year
