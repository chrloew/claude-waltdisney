# Iteration Guide

## Iteration Overview
**Iteration Number**: 1  
**Triggered By**: Overly optimistic return expectations and insufficient risk management framework  
**Focus Areas**: Realistic return targets, comprehensive risk management, accurate cost estimation, stress testing scenarios

## Key Issues to Address
- Return expectations of 80-100% are unrealistic and need adjustment to 60-80% primary target
- Risk management framework is insufficient for potential 20-40% market corrections
- Cost estimates are too low (€38k vs realistic €50k+) and missing key expense categories
- Position sizing and stock selection criteria are too vague for systematic implementation
- Missing stress testing scenarios and contingency planning for market downturns
- Options management strategy needs simplification for sustainability

## Preserved Elements
- Core hybrid approach combining growth stocks (60%) with covered calls (40%) remains sound
- Three-phase implementation structure (Foundation/Development/Launch) is well-designed
- Austrian tax optimization focus and European regulatory compliance approach
- Interactive Brokers platform selection and advisory team structure
- Focus on established Europe/US markets aligns with investor preferences
- Monthly time commitment estimates are realistic for semi-passive approach

## Specific Guidance for Next Phase

### If Returning to Realist:
**Preserve**: Three-phase structure, hybrid growth/options approach, Austrian tax optimization, advisory team composition  
**Adjust**: Return targets to 60-80% primary with 100% stretch goal, cost estimates to €50k+, options management to quarterly cycles  
**Reconsider**: Position sizing limits (add 8% per stock max), stock selection criteria (define specific screening metrics), time commitment sustainability  
**Strengthen**: Risk management rules, stress testing scenarios, emergency exit strategies, currency hedging for US exposure, performance attribution tracking

## Success Criteria for This Iteration
- Establish realistic 60-80% return targets with clear justification
- Define comprehensive risk management framework surviving 30-40% market decline scenarios
- Create accurate cost estimates with proper buffers and contingency funds
- Specify measurable stock selection criteria and position sizing rules
- Develop quarterly rather than monthly management cycles for sustainability
- Include stress testing results and emergency exit procedures

## Lessons Learned
- Initial enthusiasm for 100% returns must be tempered with market realities and historical performance data
- Risk management cannot be an afterthought - it must be integrated into core strategy from the beginning
- Cost estimates should include volatility buffers and behavioral trading impacts
- Simplicity and sustainability are crucial for investor discipline over 24-month period
- Austrian tax implications require more detailed consideration throughout implementation phases
